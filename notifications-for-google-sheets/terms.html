    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>By installing and using <strong>Notifications for Google Sheets</strong> ("the Add-on"), you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Notifications for Google Sheets is a Google Workspace Add-on that monitors your Google Sheets for changes and sends notifications to messaging platforms (Slack, Discord, Google Chat) via webhook URLs that you configure.</p>

    <h2>Use of the Add-on</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the Add-on in compliance with all applicable laws and Google's Terms of Service. You are responsible for the webhook URLs you configure and the data you choose to include in notifications. You must have authorization to send messages to any webhook endpoint you configure.</p>

    <h2>External Services</h2>
    <p>The Add-on sends data to external webhook URLs that you provide. The developer is not responsible for the availability, security, or data handling practices of Slack, Discord, Google Chat, or any other webhook endpoint you configure. You should review the privacy policies and terms of service of those platforms.</p>

    <h2>Service Availability</h2>
    <p>The Add-on relies on Google Apps Script infrastructure and third-party webhook endpoints. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service. Notification delivery depends on Google's trigger execution, network availability, and the target webhook endpoint's availability. Time-driven triggers may experience delays of up to several minutes.</p>

    <h2>Free and Paid Tiers</h2>
    <p>The Add-on offers both free and paid tiers. Free tier limitations include restricted number of rules and longer polling intervals. Paid tier features and pricing are described within the Add-on and may change with notice.</p>

    <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of the Add-on is also governed by our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Add-on is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. The developer shall not be liable for any missed notifications, delayed notifications, data loss, or any damages arising from the use of the Add-on. You should not rely on the Add-on as your sole alerting mechanism for critical or life-safety applications.</p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the Add-on after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Add-on at any time by uninstalling it. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the Add-on for violations of these terms.</p>
